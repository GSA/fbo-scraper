# Contributing
We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Here's the basic workflow.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Commit changes with a pithy, descriptive message. If it references an Issue, include the issue number.
3. Issue that pull request!
4. Await review and feedback.

Throughout this process, you should follow this repo's [style guidelines](https://github.com/GSA/fbo-scraper/blob/master/.github/STYLE-GUIDE.md).

## Any contributions you make will be under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Creative Commons License that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/GSA/data-strategy-topic-modeling/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/GSA/fbo-scraper/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This might not be strictly enforced, but this is generally a good thing.

## License
