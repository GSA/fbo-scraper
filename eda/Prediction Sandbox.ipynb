    "\n",
    "This is a Request for Information (RFI). This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This announcement is not a request for proposals, and the Government is not committed to issue a solicitation or award a contract pursuant to this announcement or based on responses to this announcement. This notice is strictly for market research to assist the Government for planning purposes. The Government will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey or the Government’s use of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking a COTS product to satisfy the Agency’s Open Source Policy that mandates that third party libraries used in development of agency applications undergo security testing.  SSA is currently using the Sonatype Nexus IQ Server product.  However, this tool does not meet data sorting, data retention and reporting requirements.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential vendors capable of meeting SSA’s requirements through a software composition analysis tool that is capable of evaluating applications for insecure third party libraries and licensing agreements.    \n",
    "Technical Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall identify and rank security vulnerabilities associated with open source third party libraries \n",
    "•\tThe solution shall provide additional context on vulnerabilities, including whether an exploit exists, potential attack vectors, and time to triage vulnerabilities.  Please specify if this information is native to the proposed solution or if a third party tool is required for this information. \n",
    "•\tThe solution shall provide prioritization rankings for which vulnerabilities to address first.\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall provide intuitive dashboard for viewing results\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall support the ability to filter security testing results\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall support the ability to generate customizable reports\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall support the ability to show the next non-vulnerable version of the component and/or the lowest risk version that is available.  \n",
    "•\tThe solution shall integrate with Jenkins and Fortify products\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall support the ability to generate custom reports about scans and projects and tailor them for different audiences (e.g., Project Managers, First Lines Supervisors, Executives, etc.)\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall retain application scan data for one year\n",
    "•\tThe solution shall support the ability to generate the following information:\n",
    "o\twhich applications are using vulnerable versions of components, \n",
    "o\tthe security scores for each application \n",
    "o\tthe age of each vulnerable component\n",
